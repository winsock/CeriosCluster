  in conjunction with the example programs that come with the
  library. This chapter covers the steps you need to take to
  incorporate MySQL++ into your own projects.</p><p>The first thing you have to do is include
  <code class="filename">mysql++.h</code> in each module
  that uses MySQL++. In modules that use <a class="link" href="ssqls.html" title="5. Specialized SQL Structures">SSQLS v1</a>, you also need to include
  <code class="filename">ssqls.h</code>.<a href="#ftn.idm47108349909120" class="footnote" name="idm47108349909120"><sup class="footnote">[23]</sup></a></p><p>At this point, your project probably still won&#8217;t compile,
  and it certainly won&#8217;t link. The remaining steps are dependent
  on the operating system and tools you are using. The rest of this
  chapter is broken up into several sections, one for each major
  platform type. You can skip over the sections for platforms you
  don&#8217;t use.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="inc-vstudio"></a>9.1. Visual C++</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="inc-vstudio-mfc"></a>Using MySQL++ in an MFC Project</h4></div></div></div><p>If you don&#8217;t already have a project set up, open

      project as you see fit.</p><p>Once you have your project open, right click on your
      top-level executable in the Solution Explorer, choose Properties,
      and make the following changes.  (Where it doesn&#8217;t

          will probably not need to use them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Under Linker | Input add the following to

          conflicts.</p></li></ul></div><p>You may want to study
      <code class="filename">examples\vstudio\mfc\mfc.vcproj</code>

      own program, you need to make some changes to the MySQL++ build
      settings. Open <code class="filename">mysqlpp.sln</code>, then right-click
      on the mysqlpp target and select Properties. Make the following
      changes for both the Debug and Release configurations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Under Configuration Properties | General,
        change &#8220;Common Language Runtime support&#8221; to the

        &#8220;Enable C++ Exceptions&#8221; from &#8220;Yes
        (/EHsc)&#8221; to &#8220;Yes With SEH Exceptions
        (/EHa)&#8221;</p></li></ul></div><p>If you have already built MySQL++, be sure to perform a
      complete rebuild after changing these options.  The compiler
      will emit several C4835 warnings after making those changes,
      which are harmless when using the DLL with a C++/CLI
      program, but which warn of real problems when using it with
      unmanaged C++.  This is why MySQL++&#8217;s Windows installer
      (<code class="filename">install.hta</code>) offers the option to install
      the CLR version into a separate directory; use it if you need
      both managed and unmanaged versions installed!</p><p>For the same reason, you might give some thought about
      where you install <code class="filename">mysqlpp.dll</code> on your
      end user&#8217;s machines when distributing your program.
      My recommendation is to install it in the same directory as
      the <code class="filename">.exe</code> file that uses it, rather than
      installing into a system directory where it could conflict
      with a <code class="filename">mysqlpp.dll</code> built with different
      settings.</p><p>Once you have MySQL++ built with CLR support, open your
      program&#8217;s project.  If you don&#8217;t already have a
      project set up, open Visual Studio, say File | New | Project,
      then choose Visual C++ | CLR | Windows Forms Application.
      Go through the wizard setting up the project as you see
      fit.</p><p>The configuration process isn&#8217;t much different from
      that for an MFC project, so go through the list above first.
      Then, make the following changes particular to .NET and
      C++/CLI:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Under Configuration Properties | General
        change the setting from /clr:pure to /clr.  (You need mixed
        assembly support to allow a C++/CLI program to use a plain C++
        library like MySQL++.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>For the Linker | Input settings, you
        don&#8217;t need <code class="filename">wsock32.lib</code>. The mere
        fact that you&#8217;re using .NET takes care of that dependency
        for you.</p></li></ul></div><p>In the MFC instructions above, it said that you need to
      build it using the Multi-threaded DLL version of the C++ Runtime
      Library. That&#8217;s not strictly true for MFC, but it&#8217;s
      an absolute requirement for C++/CLI. See the Remarks in <a class="ulink" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k8d11d4s.aspx" target="_top">the
      MSDN article on the /clr switch</a> for details.</p><p>You may want to study
      <code class="filename">examples\vstudio\wforms\wforms.vcproj</code>
      to see all this in action. Note that some of the
      paths will be different, because it can use relative
      paths for <code class="filename">mysqlpp_d.dll</code> and
      <code class="filename">mysqlpp.dll</code>.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="inc-unix"></a>9.2. Unixy Platforms: Linux, *BSD, OS X, Cygwin, Solaris...</h3></div></div></div><p>There are lots of ways to build programs on Unixy
    platforms.  We&#8217;ll cover just the most generic way
    here, <code class="filename">Makefile</code>s. We&#8217;ll use a very
    simple example so it&#8217;s clear how to translate this
    to more sophisticated build systems such as GNU Autotools or
    Bakefile.</p><p>&#8220;Hello, world!&#8221; for MySQL++ might look something
    like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">#include &lt;mysql++.h&gt;

int main()
{
    mysqlpp::String greeting("Hello, world!");
    std::cout &lt;&lt; greeting &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    return 0;
}
</pre><p>Here&#8217;s a <code class="filename">Makefile</code> for building
    that program:</p><pre class="programlisting">CXXFLAGS := -I/usr/include/mysql -I/usr/local/include/mysql++
LDFLAGS := -L/usr/local/lib
LDLIBS := -lmysqlpp -lmysqlclient
EXECUTABLE := hello

all: $(EXECUTABLE)

clean: 
    rm -f $(EXECUTABLE) *.o
</pre><p>The <code class="varname">*FLAGS</code> lines are where all of the
    assumptions about file and path names are laid out. Probably at
    least one of these assumptions isn&#8217;t true for your system,
    and so will require changing.</p><p>The trickiest line is the <code class="varname">LDLIBS</code>
    one. MySQL++ programs need to get built against both the MySQL
    and MySQL++ libraries, because MySQL++ is built on top of the
    MySQL C API library<a href="#ftn.idm47108345991200" class="footnote" name="idm47108345991200"><sup class="footnote">[24]</sup></a>
    If you&#8217;re building a threaded program, use
    <code class="filename">-lmysqlclient_r</code> instead of
    <code class="filename">-lmysqlclient</code> here. (See <a class="xref" href="threads.html" title="7. Using MySQL++ in a Multithreaded Program">Section 7, &#8220;Using MySQL++ in a Multithreaded Program&#8221;</a> for more details on building thread-aware
    programs.)</p><p>On some systems, the order of libraries in the
    <code class="varname">LDLIBS</code> line is important: these linkers collect
    symbols from right to left, so the rightmost library needs to
    be the most generic. In this example, MySQL++ depends on MySQL,
    so the MySQL C API library is rightmost.</p><p>You might need to add more libraries to the
    <code class="varname">LDLIBS</code> line. <code class="filename">-lnsl</code>,
    <code class="filename">-lz</code> and <code class="filename">-lm</code> are
    common. If you study how MySQL++ itself gets built on your system,
    you can see what it uses, and emulate that.</p><p>You may be wondering why we have used both
    <code class="varname">LDLIBS</code> and <code class="varname">LDFLAGS</code> here. Some
    <code class="filename">Makefiles</code> you have seen collect both types
    of flags in a single variable. That can work if the variable
    is used in the right place in the link command. However, this
    particular <code class="filename">Makefile</code> is made with GNU make
    in mind, and uses its standard rules implicitly. Those rules
    are designed to use these two variables separately like this.
    If you were writing your own compilation rules, you could write
    them in such a way that you didn&#8217;t have to do this.</p><p>Beyond that, we have a pretty vanilla
    <code class="filename">Makefile</code>, thanks in large part to the fact
    that the default <code class="filename">make</code> rules are fine for
    such a simple program.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="inc-osx"></a>9.3. OS X</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="inc-osx-makefile"></a>Makefiles</h4></div></div></div><p>The <a class="link" href="incorporating.html#inc-unix" title="9.2. Unixy Platforms: Linux, *BSD, OS X, Cygwin, Solaris...">generic
      <code class="filename">Makefile</code> instructions above</a>
      cover most of what you need to know about using Makefiles on
      OS X.</p><p>One thing that may trip you up on OS X is that it uses an
      uncommon dynamic linkage system. The easiest way to cope with
      this is to link your executables with the compiler, rather than
      call <code class="filename">ld</code> directly.</p><p>Another tricky bit on OS X is the concept of Universal
      binaries. See <code class="filename">README-Mac-OS-X.txt</code> for
      details on building a Universal version of the MySQL++ library,
      if you need one. By default, you only get a version tuned for

clean:

</pre><p>Note that I&#8217;ve used <span class="command"><strong>del</strong></span>
      instead of <span class="command"><strong>rm</strong></span> in the clean target. In
      the past, at least, MinGW <code class="filename">make</code>
      had some funny rules about whether commands in target
      rules would get run with <code class="filename">sh.exe</code>
      or with <code class="filename">cmd.exe</code>. I can&#8217;t
      currently get my installation of MinGW to do anything
      but use <code class="filename">sh.exe</code> by default, but that
      may be because I have Cygwin installed, which provides
      <code class="filename">sh.exe</code>.  This explains the first
      line in the file, which overrides the default shell with
      <code class="filename">cmd.exe</code>, purely to get consistent
      behavior across platforms. If you knew all your platforms
      would have a better shell, you&#8217;d probably want to use
      that instead.</p><p>Note the use of forward slashes in the path to the MySQL
      Connector/C development files. GNU <code class="filename">make</code>
      uses the backslash as an escape character, so you&#8217;d
      have to double them if you&#8217;re unwilling to use forward
      slashes.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="inc-mingw-ide"></a>Third-Party MinGW IDEs (Dev-C++, Code::Blocks...)</h4></div></div></div><p>I have no information on how to do this. We&#8217;ve
